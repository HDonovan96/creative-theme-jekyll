                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">I'm a passionate producer and full time nerd. I love film, exploring new creative pursuits, and have recently got into Warhammer 40k. I've also run a few D&D campaigns in the past. 
</p>
<p class="text-faded">
I've got experience running game dev teams, taking projects from initial conception to publishing on Itch and Steam, always with a focus on maintaining healthy and flexible practices. I'm experienced with Git, Jira, Trello, Unity, as well as Agile and Scrum theory and methodology. I've also started my own studio, Glass Nomad Games, to publish games made throughout University.
</p>
<p class="text-faded">
I'm graduating from Falmouth University in 2022, and am actively looking for Junior or Graduate Producer roles where I can learn and grow, as well as being available as a freelance Producer or Programmer. If any of this sounds like I could be a good fit for you or your company, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
