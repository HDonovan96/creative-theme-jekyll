                <p class="text-faded">I am an avid programmer and passionate producer, with a strong knowledge of
                    version control using Git, agile methodology, and an excitement for facing new, interesting
                    challenges. I have lead teams which have published to both Itch and Steam, always with a focus on
                    maintaining healthy and flexible working practices. My ideal position would be a Graduate/ Junior
                    Producer role, with a strong focus on growing my skills and experience so I could progress to a more
                    senior position.</p>
